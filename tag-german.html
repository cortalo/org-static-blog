          >End of my first German course</a
        >
      </h1>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s been a while since I wanted to document my experience in my
        German course. Now, having completed the first month, there
        couldn&rsquo;t be a better time to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, I approached the course with some dissatisfaction. The pace
        felt too slow, and I was critical of my teacher&rsquo;s methods. Boredom
        and impatience set in as I waited for others to catch up.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then I began interacting with my classmates, and I had the chance to
        hear a different world.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first people I met was a talkative Ukrainian woman. When she
        is not satisfied with something, she interrupts and shouts. She knows a
        lot about healthcare, and she told me this and that about refugee
        polices. I admire her enviable energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first walked in the classroom, I noticed a young man who already
        spoke rapid German. I asked him how he did it and he said since he
        started learning German four months ago, he only spoke German. He is
        smart and also speaks English, Turkish and Afghanistan. His experience
        reminds me a lot of the book &ldquo;The New Odyssey&rdquo;, and I am
        curious about more of his stories. He is only 19 years old, I believe a
        bright future awaits him.
      </p>

        The man sitting next to me has a political asylum visa. He was a
        political journalist not welcomed by the government. He said so he lived
        at the borderline for many years before he came here. He is no longer
        young and it was his second time to take the same course. He has a
        beautiful handwriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another young man I know a bit comes from Latin America, he often dozes
        off in the class due to his Uber delivery job. I also met a young lady
        from Turkey, she is so charming with a wonderful personality. There are
        also two resilient mothers who undertake childcare with their studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last week I finally got to know my teacher a bit. He told us he
        worked 220 hours a month at the moment so that he can pay his expense
        for he and his girlfriend, and he used to work even more. He said he had
        different trainings in different countries, and now he finally got a new
        passport. He shared with us different information that help foreigners
        maintain a basic life here.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, I still think the course is too easy for me, who has spent
        twenty years staying in schools. But I wish I had talked more with
        everyone about their lives. So many people come here, and each finds
        their own way to stay and live. Life is always hard but also incredible,
        and I wish I don&rsquo;t ever forget it.

            Ich habe seit diesem Montag einen intensiven Deutschkurs gemacht.
            Die Kurs fangt von 8:30 Uhr bis 11:45 Uhr jeden Tag an. Weil von
            mein Wohnung bis zu die Schule ich fast einen Stunden brauche, muss
            ich vor 7 aufstehen und zur Bushaltstelle runnen. Nach dem Kurs
            fahre ich mit dem Bus zur Buro und arbeite ich bis zum Abendessen.
            Danach komme ich nach Haus zuruck und mache ein paar Haushalt. Ich
            gehe circa 11 Uhr ins Bett.

            Wenn ich hier diesen Satzen schreibe, merke ich, dass ich komplexe

            This is interesting, I am still in the starting phase, I cannot
            speak fluently at all and I have grammar mistakes everywhere.
            However, now when I try to type something in english, the german
            translation pops up in my mind first. If I don&rsquo;t know the
            german, I have a problem writing it down in english. As a result, my
            written english falls back to almost the same level as german.

            All my classmates come from diverse backgrounds. At least 5 are
            Ukriainian, and at least 2 from some countries that I have never
            heard before. English is no longer a universal language, but with my
            broken german I can barely chat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even with english, I have struggled a lot introducing myself. In the
            past decade, I never had this issue since everyone around me shared
            the similar experience. I can easily position myself; which
            education I had, which university I went, what work I am doing, what
            issue I have, etc. But this coordinate system works no more in this
            class. I am only confusing others if I mention I am a PhD student.
            So you are a student, they ask, why would they pay a student?
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I asked classmate what she does on weekend. She paused, and
            said: because you are working, so the weekend is different for you,
            but I don&rsquo;t work, so there is no difference for me. And before
            this I have never thought of such a bias in my question.
          </p>

          <p>
            More and more often recently, I realize how limited my perspective
            is. I did not know what the life with a social worker is like. I did
            not know that Afghan can often speak Turkish. I did not know what my
            lecturer thinks when he works as a security guard at night. I have
            been too much caught up in my own world, such that I am unable to
            ask a meaningful question of people I don&rsquo;t understand. I want
            to know more about the difference of this world, but I don&rsquo;t
            know how.
